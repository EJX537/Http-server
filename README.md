# Programming Assignment 4
This assignment aims to create an audit log that orders the requests the server processes them.

## Building 

The httpserver program can be built with the following commands below:
```
$ make 
```

## Running

To run the program after compiling it, you can run the command:
```
$ ./httpserver [-t threads] [-l logfile] <port>
```

## Data Structure and Algorithms
A queue holds all the incoming requests and dequeues them according to availability and seniority. The queue is a linked list that acts as a bounded buffer. Flock wasn't working for me and pthread RW_Lock was not working across files. So, I created a linked list that holds metadata about the each file and lock/unlock them accordingly. All the relavent information from the client's request is stored in a Request struct. The parsing algorithm used allocates the exact memory need for the method, uri, and prot. When reading the file of uri, it does it in chucks until read returns a 0.
## Coherency and Atomicity
The audit log's coherency and atomicity is inherited from handle_connection() and the interactions between the queue and locks on the files. All request are enqueued and dequeued in the order it is recieved. The files is placed within a linked list alongside other metadata needed to lock the file to prevent read and write overrides. Additionally, there is a mutex lock when writing to the audit log to ensure atomicity. In the event that two thread wants to write to the same file. The first one will increment the writer count for that file and the other thread(s) will need to wait until the writing thread is done before signaling the file is avaliable. 
## Multi-Threading
In order to create a multi-thread server, the first things the server does is create a thread pool of size <em>thread</em>. They are put to sleep until woken up by the main thread upon incoming requests. Once a thread is notified, it will handle the connection and act upon the request in a thread safe manner using mutexes and conditional variables. Upon finishing a request, the thread will write to the audit log and return to waiting status. If two or more processes acts on a file, reading places a conditional lock on the file while writing requests the file to be free from any other threads.
Upon the server closing through SIGTERM, the serever will finish the current requests and flush outstanding requests and terminate gracefully.
## Errors
Multithreading presents errors that were unusual and that you don't think about normally. Passing references to the thread was an unexpected source of error (only in valgrind). It does not consistantly dereference pointers to all sorts of values ranging from int to structs. I noticed this error when valgrind gave me an error for invalid read-size. The obsecure nature of the error was a real head scratcher. The solution for me the use of global variables. Audit itself was largely error free.
